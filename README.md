# FortranParser
A Fortran parser in Smacc

The idea was to adapt a grammar reverse engineered from Open Fortran Project antlr grammar (https://github.com/OpenFortranProject/open-fortran-parser.git), however it proved more difficult than expected and this part of the project is now on hold.
The current solution is implemented in the OFPParser branch and relies on the antlr parser (in java) to do some of the work.
